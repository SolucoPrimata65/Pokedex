API POKEDEX
Hello, this is my first project with programming and I will explain how it works and what I used to finish it. 
- At first, I use the following languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in this project a Pok√©mon API was used to search for them; 
- And to access the project, you must download all the packages and drag the HTML document in your browser.
